# If set to a directory writable by the HTCondor user, when a job leaves the condor_schedd's queue,
# a copy of the job's ClassAd will be written in that directory. The files are named history,
# with the job's cluster and process number appended. 
# For example, job 35.2 will result in a file named history.35.2. 
# HTCondor does not rotate or delete the files, so without an external entity to clean the directory,
# it can grow very large. This option defaults to being unset. When not set, no files are written.
